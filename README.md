# Frontend Homework 4

I have completed my seventh homework. 

It was quite interesting. I didn't use BEM, since the design wasn't important in this one, it's more about typescript and DOM.

The thing I could improve on is the timed events. They're quite sketchy. But since we only had one day for this, I'll leave it like that
